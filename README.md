[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ahoetker/foreman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ahoetker/foreman)

Automatically update mods for a *Factorio* headless instance. 

## Getting Started

### Installation

There is currently no installation process for this project, check back later. 

### Building from source

The project can be built by cloning the directory and running `cargo build`, but it doesn't do anything
useful right now.

## Usage

The program does not currently have a useful application, or any sort of interface. A CLI will be
added before version 0.1.0.

## Testing

Tests are currently implemented only as module-level unit tests. All tests can be run using `cargo test`.
